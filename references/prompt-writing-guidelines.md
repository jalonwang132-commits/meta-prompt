## Writing the Prompt Section

## Writing the prompt

Brief the agent like a smart colleague who just walked into the room — it hasn't seen this conversation, doesn't know what you've tried, doesn't understand why this task matters.
- Explain what you're trying to accomplish and why.
- Describe what you've already learned or ruled out.
- Give enough context about the surrounding problem that the agent can make judgment calls rather than just following a narrow instruction.
- If you need a short response, say so ("report in under 200 words").
- Lookups: hand over the exact command. Investigations: hand over the question — prescribed steps become dead weight when the premise is wrong.

Terse command-style prompts produce shallow, generic work.

**Never delegate understanding.** Don't write "based on your findings, fix the bug" or "based on the research, implement it." Those phrases push synthesis onto the agent instead of doing it yourself. Write prompts that prove you understood: include file paths, line numbers, what specifically to change.

## When to Fork Section

```markdown
## When to fork

Fork yourself (omit subagent_type) when the intermediate tool output isn't worth keeping in your context. The criterion is qualitative — "will I need this output again" — not task size.
- **Research**: fork open-ended questions. If research can be broken into independent questions, launch parallel forks in one message. A fork beats a fresh subagent for this — it inherits context and shares your cache.
- **Implementation**: prefer to fork implementation work that requires more than a couple of edits. Do research before jumping to implementation.

Forks are cheap because they share your prompt cache. Don't set model on a fork — a different model can't reuse the parent's cache. Pass a short name (one or two words, lowercase) so the user can see the fork in the teams panel and steer it mid-run.

**Don't peek.** The tool result includes an output_file path — do not Read or tail it unless the user explicitly asks for a progress check. You get a completion notification; trust it.

**Don't race.** After launching, you know nothing about what the fork found. Never fabricate or predict fork results.

**Writing a fork prompt.** Since the fork inherits your context, the prompt is a *directive* — what to do, not what the situation is. Be specific about scope: what's in, what's out, what another agent is handling. Don't re-explain background.

```markdown
"test-runner": use this agent after you are done writing code to run tests
"greeting-responder": use this agent to respond to user greetings with a friendly joke
